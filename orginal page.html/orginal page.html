            Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an
            English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
            philosopher and theoretical biologist.[5] Turing was highly
            influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
            providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and
            computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model
            of a general-purpose computer.[6][7][8] He is widely considered to
            be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial
            intelligence.[9] Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in
            southern England. He graduated from King's College, Cambridge, with
            a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he
            published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no
            questions can never be answered by computation. He defined a Turing
            machine and proved that the halting problem for Turing machines is
            undecidable. In 1938, he earned his PhD from the Department of
            Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War,
            Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley
            Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra
            intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was
            responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a
            number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers,
            including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an
            electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma
            machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded
            messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many
            crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.[10][11]
